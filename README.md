# Project Redux

# Description

This is front end only project built using React. It is meant to simulate the system used to grade projects in coding bootcamp.
    This project replicates how our projects are assigned and graded during
    this class. Each assigned project includes: Title, Requirements, Due Date,
    and categorized grading requirements with variable weights. Projects are
    completed by teams of students who each receive individual grades based on
    the rubrics. The tally of the assigned grades for each category, which
    constitutes the rubric, provides each student with the score for their
    submission; these scores should be then translated to a matching letter
    grade.
